# middleman_starter
This is a middleman template for building websites, configured with some opinionated conventions like directory indexes and more of a directory structure....   
Theres also some standard web dev tools: HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Jquery, RiotJS, as well as a navbar and some premade stuff to speed up getting started on projects.    
(There's also a semblance of nodejs/package.json/node_modules which needs to be further configured to incorportate browserify and js and css minification into the middleman build process.)
